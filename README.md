# Vision
The AR solution that uses CMV-SDK to project Metaverse overlay into the real world.

The goal of this project is to integrate the seamless (continguous) Metaverse into the real world. 

The vision of this project is that via the Metaverse (CMV-SDK) could provide overlay of Augmented Reality technology
into the real world. This would allow us to join the "virtual" and the real world. This is alignment with the "Zone"
project based off of CMV-SDK that provides a method for aassign virtual addresses to Metaverse pages, manage property,
and join these properties & addresses with real world properties & addresses seamlessly.
